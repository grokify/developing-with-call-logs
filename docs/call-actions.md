Understanding the various actions your RingCentral users are able to execute and which are recorded in your RingCentral [Call Log](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-docs/latest/index.html#!#RefCallLogInfo.html) data is of critical importance towards leveraging the power of the Call Log API resource.

Call Actions provide you with the information about what is happening with a call currently, as compared with Call Results which denote the final outcome of a call action operation.

You can see the full list of `Call Actions` and `Call Results` in the [API Developer Guide](https://developers.ringcentral.com/api-docs/latest/index.html#!#CallActionsAndResults.html).
